# Goal: Collide with all pink boxes before the timer runs out!
# Rules: 12 second timer, one 700x700 grid. Player must collide with all pink boxes before the timer expires
# Feedback: Game will state wether or not you have impacted a pink block, as well as provide some messaging post-finish.
# Freedom: User may use WASD + Arrow Keys to move, subtract from (cancel out), or compound the speed if you're up to the challenge!

#Note to Mr. Cozort:
#Hello Mr. Cozort! I sincrerely hope you enjoy my game and that I make my programming thought processes clear in my comments.
#Originally, I wanted this game to be a sort of top-down shooter where you would have to dodge bullets, but after some
#editing and messing around with the collision models, I decided I wanted to create a time-based race game in a similar way 
#to how you might colect coins in some of those Mario levels. I actually stumbled on the delete-post-collision feature by accident!
# Anyways, I intend on incorperating some of this knowledge I've learned into my Final Project, which will likely be a platformer
#game as I watched some youtube videos which use a lot of what I've discussed below. 

#Thank you for reading this and I hope you enjoy my game!
